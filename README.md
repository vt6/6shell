# TODO
- Push there, pull here
- Implement server connection
- Implement message building and put the following hint at the beginning of this file: To build this, the `master` branch of [vt6.rs](https://github.com/vt6/vt6.rs) needs to be checked out in a sibling directory of this repo.
- Implement vt6 negotiation
- Be able to run executables in pipeline (is that already possible, only that *all* remaining input goes into the pipe?)
- When is output being flushed? And by whom? By the terminal?
  In other words, is it the terminals fault that `yes` does not print y's?
